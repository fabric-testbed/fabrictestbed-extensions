# readthedocs.org uses Python 3.7 by default; fablib has to use Python
# 3.9 or greater.  This incantation seems to work.
build:
  os: ubuntu-20.04
  tools:
    python: "3.9"

# Tell RTD location of our Sphinx configuration.  Seems to work
# without this too, although default is docs/conf.py.
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/source/conf.py

# To be able to build API documentation, we need to install both docs
# requirements and package requirements, it seems.
python:
  install:
    - method: pip
      path: .
      extra_requirements:
        - doc
